# NOTES

## Basics
- There are tags `<section>` `<head>`, which contain information in them. There are also attributes that adds some information to the tag. Example: 
```
    <a href = "https://jojo-portal.com/">Male sex porn</a>
```
The tag `<a>` contains the name-content of the link, while the attribute `href` gives the exact link.
