# NOTES

## Basics
- There are tags `<section>` `<head>`, which contain information in them. There are also attributes that adds some information to the tag. Example: 
```
    <a href = "https://jojo-portal.com/">Male sex porn</a>
```
The tag `<a>` contains the name-content of the link, while the attribute `href` gives the exact link.

- There are also semantic tags. They have special purpose, for example, `<header>` that stays at the top of the page and has navigation. There is also special tag for navigation - `<nav>`. Other semantic tags are: 
  - `<main>`
  - `<section>`
  - `<article>`
  - `<aside>`
