# Practicing Markdown
Hello, everyone! I am -- and I am practicign markdown here. Let's go over through some basic markdown first. 
## Basic Markdown
### Styling text
- To make text *italic*, we write * from both sides.
- To make text **bold** we write two * from both sides.
- To make text ***italic and bold*** we write three * from both sides.

### Quoting text and code
- To quote a text we write > in a new command line: 
> This is a quote
- To call out a `code` we write ` from both sides
- To insert the code we ` three times in two lines and insert the code in it.
```
git status
git branch
git push
```

### Links and images
